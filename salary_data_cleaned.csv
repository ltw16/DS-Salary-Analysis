5,FutureLearn Ltd,2012,Education Training Service,"We are currently looking to recruit an experienced Data Scientist into the Data Science team. The Data Science team sits in the Data & Analytics department and works alongside the Business Insights Analysts and Data and Frontend Engineers.

Our Data Scientists work on a diverse range of projects to solve key business problems, enable data-driven decision making and optimise and automate processes. In practice, this means exploiting data of heterogeneous nature (e.g., financial, web logs, marketing, behavioural, course content) to: i) scope, develop, productionise, deploy, monitor and improve scalable and automated data-science products, eventually living in a cloud environment; ii) produce self-contained statistical models and ad-hoc analyses; iii) set up and carry out experiments.

As part of FutureLearn you will be able to work within a stimulating, multidisciplinary, inclusive and diverse working environment that promotes collaboration, teamwork (AGILE framework), personal initiatives, independence and career growth.

Our Technology stack

We use Snowflake as our main data warehouse and dbt as the tool of choice for data transformations. Python is the main programming language used for our Data-Science products and we mainly use Pyspark and AWS cloud computational and automation resources to enable their scalability and automation. We recently started managing our Data-Science infrastructure with Terraform. We use Git and Github for distributed version control and source code management.

Key responsibilities of the role;

As a Data Scientist in this role you will be involved in the entire Data Science workflow. Your main responsibilities include:


Higher education is being rapidly disrupted by digitisation, globalisation and industry moving into the educational space. At the same time, people’s job security is at risk from rapidly evolving industries, robotics & AI, increasing demand for up-to-date technical, data, digital skills, and shorter job spans. Increasingly we are all transforming into lifelong learners, looking to upskill, reskill or entertain ourselves via effective educational content that provides quality, credentialed and recognised outcomes. In emerging markets the internet is accelerating this trend and opening up access to educational products from universities or institutions thousands of miles away, where previously cost, travel or admission requirements would have made study impossible.

FutureLearn was founded 8 years ago by The Open University, with the purpose of transforming access to education. Our mission is to ride the wave of these trends, and meet the needs of the professional lifelong learner across the globe. With new investment from the SEEK group, FutureLearn is now looking to expand globally, focusing on providing credible and valued lifelong learning pathways to professional learners, anywhere, any time from a mix of institutional and industry partners.
